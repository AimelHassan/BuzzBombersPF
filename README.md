# Buzz Bombers Programming Fundamentals Project

## Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic Buzz Bombers game, originally developed for the Intellivision console, created as part of a Programming Fundamentals course. The project demonstrates the application of basic C++ programming concepts with a focus on procedural programming. The game was developed using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics rendering and event handling.

## Gameplay Features

### Classic Gameplay:
Use a spray can to defend against the bees trying to ruin your garden, kill worker bees and as you advance, fight against the super fast killer bees!

#### Three Levels of Increasing Difficulty:
- **Level 1**: Hummingbirds
- **Level 2**: Worker Bees
- **Level 3**: Killer Bees

### Additional Enhancements

#### Infant Bee:
- Introduced as a dynamic gameplay element.
- Implemented using pointers to create the infant bee during runtime.

#### Level 4 - The Boss Level:
- In this level, power-ups appear to help the player defeat the final boss.
- The boss level includes all enemy types, making it the most challenging stage.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language used for implementing game logic, basic functions, and memory management.
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**: A multimedia library used for:
  - Rendering 2D graphics
  - Handling player input
  - Managing game states and events

## Key Features of the Code

### Basic C++ Concepts:
The game was developed using basic C++ concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and arrays.

### Dynamic Memory Management:
- The Infant Bee was implemented dynamically using pointers, showcasing the handling of memory allocation and deallocation.

### Game Loops and Event Handling:
- A simple game loop was implemented to manage real-time gameplay.
- Event handling was done using SFML to handle user inputs like movement and spraying.

##Learning Outcomes
###This project highlights:

1. A strong understanding of basic C++ programming, including functions, loops, and memory management.
2. Practical application of dynamic memory allocation using pointers.
3. Ability to create a simple game loop and manage real-time events.

## Installation and Setup

1. Ensure **C++17** or later is installed on your system.
2. Install **SFML 2.5.1** or the latest version:
